# Movies-App
An app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

To be able to build the app you'll need to add a Keys class having your API key
To get your API key, sign up to the movies database https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup and request one
The Keys class should look like this when added to the utils package

package com.enterprises.wayne.moviesapp.util;

public class Keys
{
    public final static String API_KEY = "YOU_API_KEY";
}
